#### Scadufax Network Scanner
This is a network scanner based on Scapy created in Python 3.11.2

##### The Objective
This project was started only for improve skills and create a network scanner with a better output interface than that Nmap (of course, its almost impossible to create a scanner better than him in functions, but the focus is exclusive on the output interface)

##### Required Libraries
* termcolor, time, datetime, socket, logging, scapy, _thread, random, os, argparse

**CAUTION:** This project is not complete, i'm still working on it.
